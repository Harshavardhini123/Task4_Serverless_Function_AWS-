# Task4_Serverless_Function_AWS-
This AWS Lambda function is a simple serverless function that responds to HTTP requests. 
When triggered via the function URL, it executes the code automatically and returns the message:
"Hello from my first cloud function!" 
This demonstrates event-driven execution without managing any servers. 
The function uses Python runtime and is deployed on AWS Lambda with a Function URL trigger.

The function can be further modified to accept parameters and return dynamic output, such as greeting users by name, demonstrating advanced serverless functionality.
